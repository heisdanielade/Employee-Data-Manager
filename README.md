## Project Title: 
Employee Data Management System

## Project Description:
The Employee Data Management System is a Python application designed to manage employee data efficiently. This project allows users to input, store, retrieve, and manipulate employee information such as names, ages, salaries, and unique IDs. The application provides a simple command-line interface for users to interact with.

## Features:
1. Input and store employee data: Users can input employee details such as first name, last name, date of birth, email, phone number, residential address, job title, department, start date, pesel number, employment status, security clearance level and salary. The data is stored in a text file for easy retrieval and management.
2. Unique employee IDs: Each employee is assigned a unique ID generated automatically by the system to ensure data integrity and identification.
3. Error handling: The application includes error handling mechanisms to handle invalid inputs and ensure data consistency.
4. Tabular representation: Employee data can be displayed in a tabular format for easy viewing and analysis.
5. Data persistence: The application ensures that employee data is persisted across sessions by storing it in a database.

This project aims to provide a simple yet effective solution for managing employee data, suitable for small businesses, startups, or personal use cases. The source code is available on GitHub for collaboration, feedback, and further development.

## Technologies Used:
- Python
- JSON (for data serialization)
- Command-line interface (CLI)
- Git and GitHub (for version control and collaboration)

## Instructions for Use:
1. Clone the repository from GitHub.
2. Run the Python script to launch the Employee Data Management System.
3. Follow the prompts to input employee data and perform various operations.
4. View, edit, and manage employee data as needed.
5. **TEMPORARILY** Data is stored in a text file ("db.txt") within the same directory as the script.

Feel free to contribute, report issues, or suggest enhancements on GitHub to improve the Employee Data Management System for broader usability and functionality.
